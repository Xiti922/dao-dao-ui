[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) renderer for all packages in the
monorepo.

| Location                     | Summary                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [`decorators`](./decorators) | Decorators to be used in story files to wrap components in necessary parent components. Mostly [React Context provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) decorators. |
| [`scripts`](./scripts)       | Scripts to assist in using Storybook.                                                                                                                                      |

## Running

```bash
yarn start

# OR, from the root of this monorepo:

yarn storybook start
```

This will launch the storybook server, accessible via a web browser at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

## Story Generator

```bash
yarn generate <glob>
```

To automatically generate a storybook file for a component, you have a few
options.

The command above will work assuming the root is this folder
(`packages/storybook`). For example, `yarn generate **/MyComponent.tsx` will
generate storybook files for any file named `MyComponent.tsx` that is a
descendant of `packages/storybook` at any level. You may also use something like
`yarn generate ../**/MyComponent.tsx` to generate storybook files for any file
named `MyComponent.tsx` in any of the packages.

### Optimizations

If the argument does **not** start with `.` (period), `/` (forward slash), or
`*` (asterisk)—which are all symbols related to path/glob syntax—it will
automatically be prefixed with `../**/*`. This will match all files and folders
descendant of `packages`.

Additionally, the argument will be suffixed with `*.tsx` if it does **not**
already end with `.tsx`, since most (if not all) of our components use that
extension.

This means that while you can use relative or absolute paths/globs for any file,
in most cases you only need to use the name of the component that you're
targeting.

### Examples

```bash
# All files that lives somewhere inside the `packages` folder with a name that starts with `ILoveMyNewHome`, such as a new component in the stateless package at `packages/stateless/components/ILoveMyNewHomeInTheUiPackage.tsx`.
yarn generate ILoveMyNewHome

# All files that live somewhere inside the `packages` folder and are immediate children of any folder that ends with `dao`, such as `packages/stateless/components/dao/*.tsx` or `packages/stateless/components/some_dao/*.tsx`
yarn generate dao/

# All files named `MyComponent.tsx` that are descendants of `packages/storybook` at any level
yarn generate "**/MyComponent.tsx"
# (quotes in case your shell performs automatic parameter expansion/globbing of unquoted text such as fish)

# A relative path, starting from the storybook package root
yarn generate ../../apps/dapp/components/IShouldProbablyLiveInTheUiPackage.tsx

# An absolute path
yarn generate /Users/me/Developer/dao-dao-ui/apps/dapp/components/WhyDoILiveHere.tsx
yarn generate ~/Developer/dao-dao-ui/apps/dapp/components/SeriouslyMoveMePlease.tsx
```
